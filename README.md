OVERVIEW:

This was a research project I did for a class called Semantics & Pragmatics. In this project I basically experimented with a number of different ways to try to ascertain if token embeddings
had any potential to be useful drivers of future contributions to formal linguistics, namely semantic theory. Overarchingly, I would say the answer to thsi question is yes. 
For the full explanation of my experiments and analysis, please see the file named "Squib Writeup". This paper is written for a non-technical audience, so feel free to skip the "background" 
section, as it is just an elementary math and LLM review. 

RELEVANT FILES:

1) Sem_Final_Proj_Explore.ipynb : this was my initial notebook where I preliminarily explored various approaches and considered their implications  
2) Sem_NPI.ipynb : this is the second notebook I made after my initial findings, aimed specifically at isolating a theoretical "NPI component" from various NPI's ("negative polarity <-- OK so I somehow duplicated and corrupted this file not sure how oops will fix this later
   items"). All mathematical assumptions, such as linear separability, are detailed in the Squib Writeup
3) Squib Writeup : this is my full, written out explanation, analysis, and conclusion of the exploratory research I conducted for this project 

PS: 
Please ignore how horrendously disorganized and ugly my Colabs are. I was in a rush because it was finals season and then was subsequently too lazy to clean them up. This formatting and 
level of coding degeneracy are not indicative of my normal programming habits (pinky promise). Anyway, enjoy my project.
